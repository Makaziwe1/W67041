                <p class="smt">Puma SE, branded as PUMA, is a German multinational corporation that designs and manufactures athletic and casual footwear,
                    apparel and accessories, which is headquartered in Herzogenaurach, Bavaria, Germany. Puma is the third largest sportswear manufacturer in the world.
                    The company was founded in 1948 by Rudolf Dassler. In 1924, Rudolf and his brother Adolf "Adi" Dassler had jointly formed the company Gebr√ºder Dassler Schuhfabrik.
                    The relationship between the two brothers deteriorated until they agreed to split in 1948, forming two separate entities, Adidas and Puma.</p>

                        <p>In the late 1970s, Argentinean tennis player Guillermo Vilas went on a title-winning rampage. Known for his one-handed backhand and off-the-court charm,
                            he paired with PUMA to create a line of tennis shoes that matched his winning style. Among them? The GV Special. And much like the man behind the legend,
                            it quickly secured its rank: Icon.</p>
